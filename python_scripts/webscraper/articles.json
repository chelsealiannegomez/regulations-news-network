            "Data privacy is becoming more important to the average American consumer. Recognizing this, nineteen states have passed comprehensive privacy legislation that tasks their attorneys general with protecting their constituents' privacy. Some of those states, including California, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas and Virginia, have even created privacy-focused subunits within the office of the attorney general. ",
            "Attorneys general in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, New Jersey and Oregon as well as the California Privacy Protection Agency have created the bipartisan Consortium of Privacy Regulators to collaborate on enforcing their respective state privacy laws.",
            "State attorneys general and other public enforcers play a huge part in shaping how businesses understand and carry out compliance with state privacy laws. As of now, only the California Consumer Privacy Act allows private parties to file legal actions for potential violations, but every state's privacy law tasks their respective attorney general with enforcement. Indeed, state attorneys general are the spearheads of carrying out privacy laws throughout the U.S.",
            "Though there are not many publicly disclosed investigations yet, each action taken sheds vital light on this ever-evolving field. Attorneys general have often brought actions to defend consumer data privacy under more general unfair competition or false advertising laws. The recent proliferation of comprehensive state privacy laws has given them new and more specialized tools to do so.",
            "Given these developments, how have attorneys general enforced enacted state privacy laws? Focusing on publicly disclosed legal actions and identifying shared trends across states over time, what lessons can be learned by only analyzing the claims made under comprehensive state privacy laws?",
            "The first comprehensive U.S. state privacy law was the CCPA, which passed in 2018 and came into effect in 2020. While there were no public legal actions taken within the first year of its enforcement, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced in 2021 that his office had sent out private notices of potential noncompliance to many businesses. In the press release, Bonta noted that \"upon receiving a notice of alleged violation, 75% of businesses acted to come into compliance within the 30-day statutory cure period.\"",
            "Anonymized notice summaries posted on the California attorney general's website provide some insight into the holistic approach taken toward enforcement. They range widely both in the recipients' industries and the referenced provisions of the CCPA. From grocery stores to car manufacturers, from inadequate privacy policies to a lack of opt-out mechanisms, Bonta has been keeping watch over as many potential infractions as possible. Soon after the enforcement sweep, one of the private notices turned public.",
            "The first public complaint under the CCPA came in 2022 when Bonta launched an investigation into the makeup and lifestyle company Sephora. The investigation resulted in a complaint and subsequent settlement of claims that Sephora illegally sold California consumer personal data by \"mak[ing] consumers\u2019 personal information available to third-party companies for the purpose of obtaining advertising and analytics,\" even though its privacy policy at the time stated that \"we do not sell personal information.\"",
            "Bonta stated that this alleged disclosure fell into the CCPA\u2019s definition of sale, regardless of whether Sephora received direct monetary compensation. Similarly, allowing third-party companies to install trackers in return for discounted or higher-quality analytics \"including the option to target advertisements to customers that had merely browsed for products online\" was also a sale. The attorney general broadly interpreted the CCPA\u2019s definition of a sale to include exchanging personal information for \"anything of value,\" a theme which runs through multiple other public CCPA complaints.",
            "The CCPA obliges businesses that sell personal information to take several compliance measures, such as disclosing what categories of personal information they collect and giving consumers the opportunity to opt out of the collection and sale of their data. Businesses must comply with both manual requests to not sell or share a consumer\u2019s personal information and global opt-out signals. These signals, such as those provided by the Global Privacy Control, transmit a do-not-sell request in a standard format to every website the consumer visits.",
            "Sephora was legally required to implement these measures and failed to do so, Bonta stated. Thus, after giving Sephora notice of potential CCPA noncompliance and waiting the requisite 30 days for a cure that failed to manifest, California's Office of the Attorney General filed the complaint. At the time, this mandatory notice-and-cure period allowed businesses to avoid liability by putting potential violations to rights. The provision requiring notice has since expired; the attorney general\u2019s office may provide notice at its discretion but is not required to do so.",
            "The parties settled for a USD1.2 million fine and the establishment of requirements that Sephora change its privacy practices. These requirements included giving notice to consumers that Sephora was selling personal information, allowing both manual opt-out requests and those made through signals like GPC and implementing a two-year assessment and monitoring program.",
            "That first broad enforcement sweep that led to the Sephora complaint was followed by more targeted sweeps focused on businesses that operate loyalty programs in 2022, businesses with mobile apps in 2023, large California employers in 2023, streaming services in 2024 and the location data industry in 2025. In this period, Bonta\u2019s office filed more complaints that sought to protect consumer privacy under California\u2019s consumer protection and protection of medical information laws, but the next CCPA action came after the sweep that targeted streaming services.",
            "In early 2024, the attorney general announced an investigation into and complaint against the food delivery company DoorDash alleging similar claims to the Sephora complaint: that DoorDash was selling consumer information in violation of the CCPA without notice or an opportunity to opt out.",
            "Instead of a traditional sale, DoorDash allegedly participated in a marketing cooperative \"in exchange for the opportunity to send mailed advertisements to customers of the other participating businesses.\" Continuing the thread of an expansive definition of \"sale,\" Bonta stated that this fell under CCPA even though it did not result in direct monetary benefit. Similar to Sephora, the existence of an alleged sale required DoorDash to provide notice and opt-out opportunities, which the company did not do.",
            "DoorDash took measures to cure the violation by ceasing to sell California consumers' personal information and requesting that the marketing cooperative delete all of their data. However, the attorney general said that this was too little too late. Other entities in the cooperative had sold the data to outside businesses, including a data broker that resold the data multiple times. Bonta stated DoorDash could not cure the violation \"because it did not make affected consumers whole by restoring them to the same position they would have been in if their date had never been sold.\"",
            "The settlement agreement included a USD375,000 civil penalty as well as requirements to provide notice and opt-out methods for selling personal information, update the privacy policy and create a three-year compliance program.",
            "Later in 2024, the California Department of Justice and Los Angeles City Attorney's Office jointly filed a complaint against Tilting Point Media, a company that creates mobile free-to-play games targeted towards children. The allegations in the complaint differ significantly from Sephora and DoorDash's infractions primarily because the complaint centers around alleged violations of the increased protections the CCPA provides to minors.",
            "With adult consumers, the CCPA permits opt-out consent, where businesses can collect and process personal information by default unless they opt out. However, minors or their parents or guardians must give opt-in consent, where they affirmatively choose to share information with the business. Tilting Point allegedly collected known children's data without authorization in violation of this provision.",
            "When users identified themselves as under 16, the app directed them to a child-specific version of the game, but Tilting Point had allegedly misconfigured its software such that it collected consumer data regardless. Tilting Point and the enforcers settled for a USD500,000 civil penalty as well as requirements related to affirmative opt-in consent, notice of how Tilting Point sells or shares personal information, an updated privacy policy and the creation of programs to monitor its practices and how it configures its software.",
            "These three complaints each allege different claims under the CCPA, but all share an assertive attitude towards privacy enforcement. They define important terms like \"sale\" and \"cure\" broadly to provide the greatest possible protection to consumers under the CCPA's terms. Press releases from Bonta\u2019s office have repeatedly emphasized the attorney general\u2019s commitment to ardent enforcement, a claim backed up by these public complaints as well as the number of notices disclosed on the attorney general\u2019s website.",
            "In 2020, the CPRA created the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is the first enforcer that is independent from the state attorney general\u2019s office. Although it has taken multiple actions under the CCPA, including a settlement with Honda and an order against clothing retailer Todd Snyder, the CPPA upholds multiple California privacy laws. Together, the California attorney general and CPPA form a dual enforcement structure that continues to evolve. As both entities develop their complementary enforcement strategies, businesses should expect more coordinated and sustained scrutiny going forward.",
            "Attorneys general from many states have not filed any complaints enforcing their privacy laws, but complaints are not the only source of insight. Six months after the Connecticut Data Privacy Act came into effect, the office of Attorney General William Tong released a report detailing its enforcement procedures and privacy-related findings.",
            "Similar to the CCPA, the Connecticut privacy law had a provision that required the attorney general to provide notice and wait 60 days for a cure for the violation, which expired on 1 Jan. 2025. The report states that Tong sent out 10 such cure notices in the first six months of enforcement across multiple industries and regarding multiple potential violations.",
            "The violations in Connecticut are like those reported by the California attorney general: absent or inadequate disclosure of a consumer's rights as well as absent or inadequate mechanisms for consumers to opt out or otherwise exercise their rights. The attorney general noted that many of the recipients of cure notices took prompt steps to rectify violations, in some cases going above and beyond to fix issues the cure notice didn't point out.",
            "However, the report also identifies some growing pains with what constitutes a cure under the Connecticut law. As with the CCPA, curing a violation may be difficult or even impossible in some cases. The report indicates a wait-and-see approach to the iterative process of figuring out what can suffice. \"[O]nly time will tell,\" it says, \"which companies fully satisfy our concerns and which matters will ultimately require more formal enforcement action.\"",
            "The report also points out that many consumers don't yet understand the finer points of submitting a violation complaint. Despite outreach efforts, of the more than 30 complaints received, around a third concerned entities or data exempted from the Connecticut law\u2019s purview. Consumers were also confused about what information they could request a business delete and what information is \"publicly available\" and thus outside of the law\u2019s scope.",
            "The report concludes with recommendations for how Connecticut's legislature could amend its privacy law to \"strengthen or clarify privacy protections.\" The section draws from provisions of other states' laws to suggest, for example, that Connecticut expand its definition of biometric data to align with a newer law in Oregon. The proposed changes also include reducing entity-level exemptions, such as exemptions for entities subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, covered entities or business associates under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and nonprofit entities. This would make the Connecticut law apply to a broader swath of businesses, similar to the scopes of California, Colorado, Delaware and Oregon.",
            "The report suggests that Connecticut enact a one-stop-shop deletion mechanism, like that in California's Delete Act, and the right to know to which third parties a business has disclosed a particular consumer's personal information, as defined in Delaware's and Oregon's respective privacy laws.",
            "These recommendations grow out of the fact the Connecticut law is both one of the earliest state privacy laws and has a slightly different style than the CCPA \u2014 its provisions follow the same general shape as the CCPA, but it has a smaller scope due to its narrower applicability thresholds and broader exceptions. Later laws have learned from the Connecticut law and changed their provisions slightly. This report shows implementing those changes into the law could help make enforcement clearer and more effective.",
            "The Texas Department of Information Resources created a similar report in late 2024 that reviewed feedback on the much newer Texas Data Privacy and Security Act. Consumers and data controllers alike indicated confusion about the specifics of the law and asked for clarification of its technical details.",
            "Texas consumers stated that they wanted more education about how to exercise their privacy rights. They found the process of doing so confusing because the method varies from controller to controller. This report was released before 1 Jan 2025, when a provision of the Texas law went into effect that requires controllers to honor global opt-out signals in certain circumstances.",
            "This can alleviate some of the frustration with the lack of streamlining or standardizing opt-out requests, but the problem with exercising rights to access, correct or delete remains. Consumers also indicated confusion about how long their preferences would remain in effect. One asked \"(i)f I opt out of sale of my data at one point in time, and then the business gets new data about me, do I need to opt out again?\"",
            "Data controllers who responded to the survey reported similar confusion, especially with definitions of terms like \"data deletion\" and \"publicly available information.\" They disliked the uncertainty of yet another compliance burden on top of all the other state privacy laws and advocated for a single federal standard to simplify operations.",
            "For example, most state privacy laws provide a cure period, where the attorney general's office must send a controller notice of a potential violation; the controller then has some time to cure the alleged wrong to avoid official action. However, the Texas law is unique in that this cure period is mandatory and exists in perpetuity. Other states provide for discretionary notice or include a sunset clause for this provision. The report recommended that Texas revise its cure provision to bring it into alignment with those of other states.",
            "In March 2025, the Oregon Department of Justice released a report on the first six months of enforcing the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act. Oregon's dedicated Privacy Unit has started out with outreach and education efforts, including sending \"light\" cure letters to data brokers with privacy policies that did not comply with the state\u2019s privacy law and running an informational marketing campaign for consumers. Like some other states, the Oregon DOJ opened a consumer complaint portal on its website, through which consumers reported confusing privacy policies and difficulties exercising their privacy rights, especially the right to delete their data.",
            "These reports show a microcosm of the wider privacy landscape: consumers and businesses alike aren't quite sure yet how to adapt to the rights and responsibilities created by privacy laws. They show a glimpse into the important behind-the-scenes collaboration between the public and private sectors working towards setting standards that are sustainable for both.",
            "In stark contrast, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton exploded onto the scene a month after the DIR report by filing the first ever formal lawsuit under a state privacy law, even though the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act is a relatively new law that only came into effect 1 July 2024. The complaint includes a demand for a jury trial \u2014 the first public complaint to do so. California's actions were only announced along with their associated settlements, so this is the first contested action filed under a comprehensive state privacy law.",
            "Paxton alleged that the data analytics company Arity, a subsidiary of the insurance company Allstate, violated the Texas law by collecting and processing consumer data without notice, consent or a way for consumers to exercise their privacy rights. Arity allegedly licensed tracking software to developers of mobile applications that offered location-based services, like tracking prices at local gas stations or getting alerts when a family member arrives or leaves certain places.",
            "\u00a0The complaint claimed that this software harvested, among other things, a consumer's \"phone's latitude, longitude, speed, GPS time, bearing, and altitude\" and sent it back to Arity. The complaint also alleged that Arity bought data from car manufacturers to refine the data it collected, selling it to insurance companies without notice or consent from consumers.",
            "This marks a sea of change in the history of comprehensive state privacy laws; it may be the first lawsuit to enforce them in the U.S., but it certainly will not be the last. Public enforcers are aware of increased privacy consciousness among their constituents. For example, the report from the Texas DIR stated that 77% of respondents were \"very concerned\" with how businesses use their data.",
            "Oregon's report found that in the first six months of the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act coming into effect, its online consumer complaint portal received more than triple the number of complaints as did Connecticut's similar complaint portal in its own first six months. Consumers are becoming more aware of their rights and the effect that potential breaches could have on their lives. Some enforcers are responding with actions to show that their laws have teeth.",
            "This period of rapid data-privacy-related development in the public and private sectors has created growing pains for both domains. Some public enforcers are securing settlements with massive monetary and injunctive penalties for alleged violations of fundamental tenets of state privacy laws, like disclosing what data a business collects or providing methods for consumers to exercise their privacy rights. At the same time, attorneys general in other states are requesting increased funding to deal with an influx of complaints and potential violations.",
            "For their part, consumers are also still coming to grips with what rights they have and how to exercise them. In 2023, the IAPP surveyed consumers and found that 68% of respondents said they are either somewhat or very concerned about their online privacy. However, only 30% of respondents had a strong understanding of what personal information industries collect and why and how they use it.",
            "Across the U.S., private and public entities are locked in a complex negotiation with each other to determine what a \"sale\" or a \"cure\" is under applicable laws. These terms radically impact the scope of what these laws cover, but there is still a dearth of solid precedent on which to build a shared understanding. Young as they are, state privacy laws have still shaped how all stakeholders approach data privacy practices.",
            "Whether through soft power outreach like notice letters or through aggressive legal actions, the ultimate goal for public enforcers is compliance with law. At the IAPP's Global Privacy Summit, a panel of officials from the CPPA and the offices of the attorneys general of Colorado and Oregon emphasized the need for cooperation and transparency within and across sectors. These states are part of the Consortium of Privacy Regulators, which aims to avoid more piecemeal enforcement and harmonize it throughout the states.",
            "As the older state privacy laws settle in and the newer ones come into effect, regulators are leveraging their growing expertise to take strategic, targeted enforcement actions, often focusing on sectors with high consumer impact or business practices that have been brought to light by consumers and others. As the regulatory landscape matures, companies should expect state attorneys general to move fluidly between both headline-grabbing settlements and a steady track record of privacy enforcement that shapes compliance expectations nationwide.",

The latest example comes with U.S. Congress' proposed 10-year ban on enforcing state artificial intelligence laws, viewed by state lawmakers and enforcers as cutting into their respective authority and mission to serve their constituents.",
            "The moratorium emerged from the U.S. House's budget reconciliation proposal in May and has withstood criticism and updates to reach a potential full Senate vote. The current iteration of the moratorium, characterized in the Senate bill as a \"temporary pause,\" moves away from an outright ban and ties states' compliance to their right to access a federal funding pool for broad infrastructure improvements.",
            "IAPP Managing Director, Washington, D.C., Cobun Zweifel-Keegan, CIPP/US, CIPM, redlined the latest changes to the provision, which is still receiving bipartisan opposition in the Senate despite momentum toward inclusion in the final bill text. The Senate bill will require concurrence back in the House, where opposition now exists after the lower chamber's initial approval of the AI provision.",
            "According to Politico, the Senate parliamentarian is asking the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to clarify the exact nature of the broadband funding tie before the provision can move forward. Confusion exists as to whether noncompliance would prohibit access to the full USD42 billion fund or a USD500 million allocation, with the former scenario likely to add to existing Senate Republican opposition.",
            "The motivation behind the moratorium is clear: Avoid watering down a booming industry with fragmented regulation. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has touted his AI proposal as necessary to support American leadership on AI innovation.",
            "While Congress is focused on AI's potential, states are keeping consumer safety front and center.",
            "States have been firm with their displeasure over the moratorium from the onset. State lawmakers and enforcers have sent multiple letterspleading their case against limiting states to establish AI governance requirements and mitigate harms that may crop up from AI development and use.",
            "\"There's nothing to fall back on. This moratorium\u00a0actually reduces rights that people currently have,\" California Privacy Protection Agency Executive Director Tom Kemp told the IAPP. \"We've always believed, whether it's AI, automated decision-making or privacy, there should be a high floor. But even then, there should be an ability for states to go over and beyond to best address the needs of their constituents.\"",
            "In the latest opposition letter, Kemp joined six state attorneys general to reiterate to Senate leadership how the proposal does not benefit consumer protection. They claimed the ban would \"create a regulatory vacuum that benefits AI developers at the expense of privacy rights\" and AI-driven technology \"demands the flexibility and responsiveness that only multi-level governance can provide.\"",
            "Meanwhile, industry recognizes the appetite for firm guardrails, but largely views a potential state patchwork as unworkable.",
            "OpenAI Associate General Counsel for AI Policy and Regulation Ben Rossen, CIPP/US, said the state patchwork on comprehensive privacy law is \"not ideal\" but has become \"manageable\" due to aligned concepts and provisions. However, he indicated the many interpretations of AI across state lines might not yield the same sense of harmonization.",
            "\"The AI moratorium is actually a fascinating thing,\" Rossen said at the IAPP and Berkman Klein Center For Internet and Society's Digital Policy Leadership Retreat 2025. \"More than 1,000 bills have been proposed on AI in the past six months. Some of them really do kind of regulate these sort of fundamental national security questions. ... But a state-level patchwork of all these frontier (AI) regulations would also be really damaging.\"",
            "State lawmakers are singing a consumer-focused refrain in their opposition to the moratorium.",
            "In a 3 June letter to Congress, lawmakers harped on needing the ability and runway to support consumer concerns and risks. They wrote, \"AI will raise some of the most important public policy questions of our time, and it is critical that state policymakers maintain the ability to respond.\"",
            "The letter also covered how states can be \"more nimble in their response\" to AI than Congress and a moratorium in this moment would \"would freeze policy innovation in developing the best practices for AI governance at a time when experimentation is vital.\"",
            "\"Over the past several years, states across the country have enacted AI-related laws increasing consumer transparency, setting rules for the government acquisition of new technology, protecting patients in our health care system, and defending artists and creators,\" lawmakers wrote.",
            "In prior remarks to the IAPP on the passing of the Texas Responsible Artificial Intelligence Governance Act, state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Texas, raised similar flags spelled out in the letter. He argued the vague and proscriptive nature of the current provision is not workable while Congress does not currently have an immediate federal fallback if issues arise in the next 10 years.",
            "\"I appreciate all the federal government does. However, they have not really been able to work on super complicated, technical things like this for a long time and actually get them passed,\" Capriglione said. \"I would make the case (Congress) is still quite a ways away from having something in place that will sufficiently protect my constituents here in the state of Texas.\"",
            "Hall Estill Partner Collin Walke served as Democrat member of the Oklahoma House from 2016-22, spearheading the state legislature's comprehensive privacy law efforts over multiple years. A common refrain in his side of debates was Oklahoma needed to act because Congress was not, an argument he insists is resurfacing here.",
            "\"It's astounding that the federal government would prohibit states from taking up important issues affecting their citizens,\" Walke told the IAPP. \"We elect our officials to solve problems. If our federal delegation is unwilling to act, the states absolutely must.\"",
            "There is a difference between an attempt to harmonize approaches versus the objective of the moratorium, according to Center for Democracy and Technology CEO Alexandra Reeve Givens. She told IAPP-Berkman Klein Center retreat attendees that the proposed ban can be viewed as 10-year \"free pass\" and supports state legislators fighting back.",
            "\"You can't deny the rights of different jurisdictions, whether regulatory agencies or, in this case, states, to do their jobs and protect their citizens if people at the federal or harmonized level aren't doing so,\" she said.",
            "State Rep. Steve Elkins, D-Minn., told the IAPP that Minnesota has AI-focused laws concerning deepfakes in elections and revenge porn that would clearly be paused under the moratorium. Minnesota's comprehensive privacy law, which Elkins authored and takes force 31 July, might also be a casualty based on its AI ties in definitions and provisions for \"profiling\" and \"legally consequential decisions.\"",
            "\"These provisions would probably be preempted even though the words 'artificial intelligence' are nowhere to be found in these provisions,\" Elkins said. \"I think it's silly to try to define AI for this use case. There is a continuum of mathematical prediction techniques used to \"profile\" consumers, ranging from regression analysis to neural networks. Even within the neural network family of techniques there is a continuum with respect to transparency. No judge or jury will ever be able to find that boundary.\"",
            "Unlike Elkins, Walke does not envision existing state privacy laws getting swept up in the budget provision.",
            "\"That would be a big legal fight given the number of states that have enacted such legislation,\" he told the IAPP. \"And there's the fact that most companies are already able to comply with the data privacy laws on the books, so there is no longer a reason to push back.\"",
            "Walke added the legal battles are likely to come from states with a \"heavy technological presence\" while others have \"little incentive\" to challenge because AI is not a legislative priority for them.",

            "What was cool was that these young people stuck around for the entire day and as different presentations were made on the main stage, at each turn, they asked from their table in the audience \u2014 over the microphone so that everyone could hear \u2014 some pointed and difficult questions of the presenters. And these, I would add, were not planted questions.",
            "I thought it was particularly meaningful because the data protection authorities from the G7 countries were all listening and taking notes. I know from the final DPA remarks and the cocktail reception after the event that they were all influenced by the day's conversations and interactions. I shared quite a few details about the day in a LinkedIn post, so those who were not there could get a flavor of it.",
            "Youth privacy is a big concern today and I'm totally on-board with creating a better environment for them as they explore this new frontier. Some of my clients are social media companies and I can see from working with them that they want to do right by our planet's youth. One of my clients has me do a weekly scan of anything that might be relevant to them just in this space alone \u2014 it's that important.",
            "Late last week an opposition party member of Parliament introduced Bill C-216, a private-member's bill called \"An Act to enact the Protection of Minors in the Digital Age Act and to amend two Acts.\" Private member's bills rarely get through the legislative process. This one, however, may have some merit, so we will be watching it closely when Parliament resumes in the fall.",
            "Here is a quick summary of the proposed new law:",
            "Protection of Minors in the Digital Age Act",
            "Mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse material",
            "Criminal Code amendments",
            "To say the least, partisan politics aside, this issue is a pressing and important one. In fact, it is one of the most important of our generation and the world we leave our kids and grandkids. (The youngest just graduated high school this week. I'm not in a rush; just sayin'.)",
            "Let's collectively build on the momentum to figure out ways this can be done and done in a way that, as the young people said last week, respects their privacy but also their autonomy and ability to grow, explore, be creative and be human.",

It begs the question whether regulation can be done \"right\" and what that looks like, especially with the EU looking more and more likely to stop the clock on implementation of the landmark AI Act with an eye toward reassessing its regulatory approach.",
            "Speaking at the IAPP and Berkman Klein Center For Internet and Society's Digital Policy Leadership Retreat 2025, Irish Member of European Parliament Michael McNamara indicated all signs point to an AI Act pause because stakeholders simply \"need time and need to know what it is they have to adhere to.\" But he warned attendees about the potential perils of any sort of pause.",
            "\"The AI Act is very far from perfect, but I do think it was a welcomed attempt to govern in this area,\" McNamara said. \"I think a delay is acceptable, but there comes a point at which any delay, if it's for a long time, just kind of deprives (the regulation) of the momentum it needs to work. That would be a concern.\"",
            "The signs are clear, according to McNamara. Escalated pressures, notably led by the U.S., around perceived burdens brought on by EU digital regulation is one factor while a lag in providing essential deliverables for AI Act implementation is another.",
            "The chief concern around implementation derives from the European Commission stretching out the deadline to release the general-purpose AI code of practice, which aims to help AI Act covered entities better understand and prepare for the act's GPAI requirements to take effect 2 Aug.",
            "McNamara said the release of the code before the GPAI requirements take force \"looks ambitious now,\" making an implementation delay a logical option.",
            "\"It hasn't been finalized yet and the date it was expected to be finalized was 2 May. Obviously that's passed and we don't see any immediate finalization (coming soon),\" said McNamara, adding that covered entities are are focused on the code as a \"presumption of compliance.\"",
            "The EU is not alone in trying to find a regulatory balance on AI. Japan and South Korea offer recent examples of frameworks that divert from the AI Act while U.S. state-level legislation ranges from covering cross-sectoral AI development and use to more targeted legislation, including bills on automated decision-making and deepfakes.",
            "OpenAI Associate General Counsel for AI Policy and Regulation Ben Rossen, CIPP/US, told retreat attendees AI-specific legislation is in flux, but that does not mean companies do not have existing statutes in sight when they are developing and using new technologies.",
            "\"In some ways, there is a host of regulation that already exists. There's consumer protection law, tort law, product liability law and all these things that already exist to regulate AI,\" Rossen said. \"And yet, the very common perception is that AI is still largely unregulated.\"",
            "The application of new or existing laws remains a point of friction. Companies cannot be left uninformed, according to Guido Scorza, board member for Italy's data protection authority, the Garante, and enforcers must take seriously their responsibility to spell out the law clearly.",
            "\"The tension between innovation and regulation isn't new at all,\" Scorza said. \"We were, and probably still aren't, always able to to give industry legal certainty in time. That's our most important responsibility, because it's our duty to recognize if society is changing and needs a faster regulatory solution than in the past.\"",
            "The panel discussed the potential for more self-regulation among AI companies in the absence of hard rules.",
            "Rossen said context is important, as broad self-regulation over AI \"does not strike anybody in industry as a responsible way of regulation.\" However, he indicated a common \"preparedness framework\" currently adopted across large AI developers is creating foundational standards.",
            "While the framework isn't identical among companies, the aim to evaluate safe AI capabilities while emphasizing risk assessment is a common priority.",
            "\"There are huge incentives already for companies to take the challenge that AI poses extremely seriously, regardless of regulation,\" Rossen said.",
            "Scorza said he \"can't accept\" self-regulation, noting AI's inherent connection to fundamental rights, including speech and privacy, leaves \"no space\" for companies to police themselves. Instead, he pitched co-regulation where policy makers set a flexible framework aimed at closer cooperation with companies.",
            "Policy makers are left to regulate what is \"being deployed in the public space,\" according to McNamara, making self-regulation a measure for developers' internal practices.",
            "\"What people do in the privacy of their own labs is a different matter,\" McNamara said. \"That's when their own regulation, boards, etc., come into play. And quite frankly, it's relationships that they have with states and nation states because there are close links.\"",

The council and the European Parliament reached a long-awaited provisional agreement on the file 16 June.",
            "The proposed regulation aims to accelerate enforcement of cross-border cases, one of the most criticized aspects of the GDPR, by harmonizing some national procedural rules. The provisional agreement introduces binding deadlines for enforcement procedures and certain rights to both the complainant and the parties under investigation, such as the right to be heard during different stages of the procedure and the right of access to the case information. Without the final text, uncertainty remains surrounding resolution of some disputed topics, such as the European Data Protection Board's role in the dispute resolution mechanism.",
            "The European Commission tabled this proposal in the summer of 2023. As a previous European Parliament's \"unfinished business\" file, it was carried over to the new parliamentary term last summer. The new rules aiming to improve GDPR enforcement will enter into force after the official adoption of the text by both institutions, fine-tuning by lawyer-linguists and publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.",
            "Another development in the field of data protection: Receiving of Royal Assent last week, the Data (Use and Access) Act became law. This is an important moment in the evolution of the U.K.'s approach to data protection after Brexit, as the act introduces new data sharing rules, including on the access and use of health care information, consumer and traffic data, and rules on digital identity verification. According to the U.K. Government, the new legislation will \"unleash the power of data\" and make British people's \"day-to-day lives easier.\"",
            "It remains to be seen whether these changes in the U.K. data protection regime will affect the EU adequacy decisions allowing free flows of personal data between the EU and U.K., which are up for review by the Commission at the end of this year.",
            "Regarding the intersection between privacy and artificial intelligence, France's data protection authority, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libert\u00e9s, released new recommendations on development of AI systems. The advice focuses on the use of legitimate interest as a legal basis and includes an assessment that can be used to determine whether legitimate interest can be relied upon, specific cases in which it is allowed or not and examples of safeguards to be used, such as omitting the collection of certain data.",
            "With the next batch of the EU AI Act's implementation deadlines approaching in August, the Commission launched a public consultation to gather input on implementing the regulation's rules on high-risk AI systems. Until 18 July, stakeholders are invited to share practical examples of AI systems and identify issues they want to be addressed in future commission guidelines, including the classification of high-risk AI systems, high-risk requirements and obligations and responsibilities along the AI value chain.",
            "At the same time, the topic of possibly delaying the AI Act's implementation was widely discussed this month. Some believe that postponing the entry into application of certain AI Act rules would be appropriate, especially if relevant guidance and technical standards are not finalized. Head of Office and Digital Policy Adviser for MEP Axel Voss, European People's Party, in the European Parliament Kai Zenner and Resaro Chief Trust Officer Sebastian Hallensleben highlighted the risks of delaying the act's implementation and suggested certain next steps the Commission should take.",
            "At least some of the uncertainty is hoped to be clarified in the next digital simplification omnibus, but the question is if it will happen soon enough, as important implementation deadlines are just around the corner.\u00a0 \u00a0",

            "China has been in a heat wave since we stepped into June, and for companies falling short on artificial intelligence and data privacy compliance, the regulatory climate is just as intense. As temperatures rise, so does the pressure on organizations to meet increasingly stringent legal and regulatory standards.",
            "In recent weeks, China's key regulatory authorities \u2014 including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, the People's Bank of China, the State Administration for Market Regulation and their regional counterparts \u2014 have launched a series of enforcement campaigns. These efforts are focused on a range of digital concerns, including mobile apps, generative AI technologies, internet fraud, cyberbullying, facial recognition systems, biometric data processing and cybersecurity risks.",
            "In Shanghai, the CAC identified that several generative AI platforms failed to conduct mandatory security impact assessments. This oversight led to the generation of content involving pornography, violence, money laundering and violations of personal data rights. As a result, some companies were required to carry out comprehensive corrective actions and their AI services were suspended pending review.",
            "Regulators in Beijing have requested AI companies and service providers strengthen compliance across the entire AI life cycle \u2014 including the filing of large language models, training data evaluation, content monitoring, regulating application programming interfaces, accountability of AI in health care and finance fields, and protection of children's information. Nearly 100 noncompliant AI accounts were recently shut down. With China's AI labeling rules set to take effect in October, the CAC is urging service providers to implement proper labeling for AI-generated content, including text, images, audio and video.",
            "Beyond AI-specific measures, Beijing regulators are also intensifying their focus on consumer-facing sectors such as smart parking, online food delivery, hotel booking, education, entertainment ticketing, online medical platforms and even digital fuel stations. A recent random audit of 197 mobile apps \u2014 affecting more than 50,000 business operators \u2014 revealed various issues, including failure to disclose privacy policies, unauthorized collection of personal information, lack of adequate security measures, and improper API authorization processes. In response, the CAC plans to conduct routine inspections and has introduced a whistleblower hotline. A public blacklist of violators will also be published periodically.",
            "Similar enforcement actions are underway in other major cities and provinces, including Tianjin, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, reinforcing a coordinated national approach.",
            "These developments indicate a clear and consistent trajectory: China's regulators are significantly strengthening governance around AI and personal data protection. This trend is expected to continue. It is vital for businesses to stay informed of regulatory trends and take timely actions to align with compliance expectations.",

            "The issue lies in the very systems our society has built. Centralized platformsthat form the backbone of today's internet are vulnerable because few hands hold a high concentration of data; thissystem makes data breaches unavoidable. Privacy, which should be a basic right, has become something people have to advocate for \u2014 bit by bit. Large-scale breaches and compromises of sensitive data are signs of a deeper problem with how centralized systems handle data.",
            "Nonetheless, a significant shift is happening in organizations' approach to privacy and trust. There is less reliance on centralized institutions, and more trust is being placed in technology itself.",
            "Blockchain is at the core of this transformation.",
            "While Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies may first come to mind for many, blockchain is much more than that application. It is a fundamental rethinking of how trust, control and privacy is managed online. It ensures security through mathematics, cryptography and distributed consensus, rather than depending on central authorities to protect information.",
            "Zero-knowledge proofs are one of the most powerful ways blockchain reforms privacy. The cryptographic method is used to prove knowledge about a piece of data without revealing the data itself. An individual, for example, could prove they are over 18 without revealing their actual birth date or that their income falls within a certain range without providing tax returns.",
            "Users can authenticate themselves or verify claims without exposing any underlying personal sensitive data using zero-knowledge proofs. Instead of having to share personal information to participate in the digital world, blockchain technology allows individuals to maintain control over their data.",
            "This technology could be a game-changer for privacy and user autonomy.",
            "Decentralized identifiers are another powerful way to give individuals full control over their digital identity. Today, most individuals can be identified online through email addresses, social media accounts and/or government-issued IDs. These forms of identification are all created and controlled by others and can be taken away, misused, breached or changed without consent.",
            "In contrast, decentralized identifiers let individuals create and manage their own secure digital ID without relying on companies or governments. Individuals could have their own ID and decide how, when and with whom this information is shared and for how long. It's like a personal passport for the internet.",
            "Decentralized identifiers and zero-knowledge proofs enable a new identity model where users control their data and only reveal what is necessary through selective disclosure. With selective disclosure, individuals have granular control over data and the power to choose exactly what relevant information to share.",
            "Because blockchain systems are transparent yet pseudonymous by default, they support these privacy enhancements without compromising accountability or security.",
            "Blockchain is also open to everyone. There are no gatekeepers and no necessary permissions. That might sound contrary to privacy, but blockchain builds privacy rights and trust into its design and into the system itself, unlike traditional systems where access is controlled.",
            "As Web3, a decentralized internet where users own their data, identities and digital assets, approaches privacy must be more than a feature. It must be the foundation. Web3 is not about rebuilding the same systems with polished interfaces, but a fundamental reconsideration of how digital interactions should work and give individuals autonomy and sovereignty over their digital selves.",
            "Blockchain is not a magical solution. Like any technology, it can be poorly built, used carelessly or simply misunderstood. New threat actors and attack vectors will find emerging technologies like blockchain. So, privacy must be thoughtfully designed from the ground up. Especially in blockchain, where recorded data is permanent and can't be erased, tough questions must be asked, like how to protect people's privacy while still keeping systems accountable and how toensure transparency doesn't come at the cost of personal freedom.",
            "These are real challenges. On the other hand, the opportunity for improvement is exciting: a future where individuals don't have to trade their privacy to participate in the digital world nor have to give up control for the sake of convenience. It won't be easy, but the opportunity to reshape how we interact online is too crucial to ignore.",
            "In this new paradigm, privacy is not an add-on but present by design and default as protocol. Blockchain offers a blueprint for a world where an individual's digital identity is a reflection of their autonomy and sovereignty.",
            "The battleground for privacy has expanded beyond activists and technologists \u2014 it's now a mainstream concern for all who interact with the digital world. Blockchain isn't just another tool in the fight for privacy, it is reshaping the very ground on which the battle is fought.",

Consumer protection- and rights-focused approaches to policy, like those in some of the EU\u2019s applicable laws, may lead to more uniform governance measures. Co-regulatory approaches, such as those implemented in Singapore, arguably leave more room for organizations to decide how they can best govern AI use and AI systems.",
            "Various jurisdictions have or are contemplating national AI legislation. Brazil\u2019s senate has approved legislation that will now be deliberated in the lower chamber. South Korea passed and signed the AI Basic Act into law and will provide greater regulatory guidance in 2025.

Read the IAPP's full analysis of the South Korean AI Basic Act and commentary around the future of AI legislation in Latin America.",
            "Japan recently passed the Act on the Promotion of Research and Development and the Utilization of AI-Related Technologies, which strikes a departure from previous iterations of wide-reaching AI legislation. Unlike previous bills, such as those in Colorado, the EU, or South Korea, it focuses more on spurring innovation through government support rather than consumer protections, marking a shift in global AI policy.",
            "The U.S. has also changed course with the new Republican administration and control of Congress. Overall, the new administration appears to be prioritizing innovation in its new AI policy. This shift can be seen in the name change of the AI Safety Institute to Center for AI Standards and Innovation as well as the new U.S. Office of Management and Budget memoranda that places a greater emphasis on innovation.",
            "A moratorium on the enforcement of state and local AI regulations has been debated as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. One of the stated goals of the proposed moratorium is to increase innovation by simplifying the regulatory burden organizations are facing by only allowing enforcement of federal AI laws or, for example, technology-neutral consumer protection laws. The AI Diffusion Rule, which restricted the flow of the most powerful microchips under the Biden administration, has been scrapped in the name of boosting innovation. The government will instead include access to the same chips as part of their negotiated trade bills. Both examples indicate that U.S. policy is moving towards more relaxed regulations on AI use and development.",
            "Given the changing tides in AI policy in the U.S. and around the world, how are other countries responding? The Brussels Effect, or the influence the EU has outside of its borders through its internal policies, seems to have been challenged by growing geopolitical competition among aspiring leaders in AI development who desire to reap the economic rewards of succeeding in the AI development and deployment race. While there still is EU-inspired risk-based legislation popping up in U.S. states and South Korea, policies are shifting towards a greater emphasis on innovation and less on guardrails and consumer protection. Japan\u2019s new law is a good example of this shift.",
            "There have been instances of the EU itself forgoing legislation that might be harmful to AI developers, such as the AI Liability Directive, and focusing on finding ways to increase innovation in AI development in the bloc. The European Commission's AI Continent Action Plan is at the heart of their efforts to do so; it invests 200 billion euros in AI efforts, with 20 billion euros earmarked for AI gigafactories.",

While the goal of this initiative is to strengthen their competitiveness, they also are providing organizations with services, such as the AI Act Service Desk, to help navigate the EU AI Act\u2019s requirements. Overall, it seems that Brussels is also shifting its policies to try to capture the economic benefits of AI, including by possibly delaying or watering down the AI Act.",
            "Behind the push to innovate is the expectation of economic gains. AI is broadly expected to boost global between USD7 trillion over 10 years up to USD25 trillion annually by some estimates. Japan sees AI as a path out of its economic slump, a goal reflected in its domestic actions like new light-touch regulations and exemptions that allow AI developers to use copyrighted material in their training datasets.",
            "The U.S. Congressional Budget Office recently released a report on AI and its potential effects on the economy and the federal budget. With only 5% of businesses and 9% of employees utilizing AI, the report shows the adoption by businesses remains limited. It highlights that AI's impact on the economy is generally positive.",
            "While a majority of employers have not seen AI as a factor for decreasing employment counts, almost all employees will see some level of automation in their work when AI is sufficiently integrated. AI will increase the productivity of workers and free up time for higher level tasks as it becomes more integrated. This effect will likely be felt over the next decade as the adoption figures rise.",
            "Even without factoring potential impacts to the economy through productivity gains or effects to the labor market, investors are already heavily funding AI and its supporting infrastructure, which will, by itself, make a huge mark on economic growth. To power further adoption and advancement in AI, more AI-powering chips will need to be produced, additional data centers built to house them and greater electric supply secured to power them.",
            "In 2023, it was predicted that AI investment could reach USD200 billion by 2025. In 2024, the U.S. saw more than USD109 billion invested in AI \u2013 with a wide gap in investment between the U.S. and the EU, which saw less than USD20 billion in AI investment overall. This disparity in investment might be driving the EU\u2019s fear of missing out on an economic growth engine and its rethinking of constraining AI development and deployment.",
            "Countries seem to be looking for ways to address AI's negative impacts while simultaneously trying not to discourage investment or development. Keeping an eye on the developments and trends is important because each country will have its own approach in an ever-changing environment. This tension between economic growth and individual rights or consumer protections is seen across the globe. A poll recently found that 77% of Americans \"want companies to create AI slowly and get it right the first time, even if that delays breakthroughs.\" For policymakers, the difficulty is to set up the conditions to ensure companies are making breakthroughs while insuring they get it right the first time.",
            "It is likely organizations will pursue AI governance, regardless of the official AI policies and threat of increasing regulation. Organizations will still need to internally align the use and development of AI with their stakeholders and pursue risk-minimizing strategies \u2014 all of which an effective AI governance program will do. Even more so, non-AI-specific laws will still apply to AI systems, such as those concerning non-discrimination, data privacy and rules around non-consensual sexual imagery; organizations would have to comply with these targeted areas of AI legislation.",
            "Despite the change of emphasis from AI risk in global AI policy in favor of innovation, AI governance inside organizations will likely see more relevance in the next few years.",
